### Additional Information:

- Ensure that your `Makefile` is correctly set up to compile the program. Here is a basic example of what your `Makefile` might look like:

```makefile
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-Wall -Wextra -std=c99
TARGET=syntax-machine

all: $(TARGET)

$(TARGET): main.o
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $(TARGET) main.o

main.o: main.c
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c main.c

clean:
    rm -f *.o $(TARGET)
```
